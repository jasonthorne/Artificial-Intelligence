## Deployment

There are two methods of deployment **Eclipse IDE  or CMD line**. The command line method is faster because you only need to install java.

* **Eclipse**          
Launch Eclipse and set the workspace as the root folder that was extracted from the GitHub project. Select the folder using the Eclipse pop-up window browse button. Create a new project File tab --> New --> Project --> Java Project and name it **AIProject**. This is the name of the folder containing the project, Eclipse will pull in the files into the created project. Run the project by selecting the Run tab --> Run.

* **Command Line**          
Launch the command Line and navigate to the Root folder --> AIProject -->. Once inside the AIProject folder run the command **java â€“cp ./game.jar ie.gmit.sw.ai.GameRunner**.
